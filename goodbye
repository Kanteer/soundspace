Hello everyone watching this video, if you've even made it this far.

I have to leave the community now, I have no other choice. My mental health has taken a toll since I joined, and this is the end. I can't keep playing, or else I would be killing myself. I've hurt my wrist and arm so many times, as well as my family. Sound Space made me a person I never even wanted to be, and I honestly think this is for the better. 

If you are sad, don't feel that way. Be happy. Be happy that I joined the community and be glad that I've been in it.

To all the young minds depressed and sadened by my sudden leave, don't cry or mourn. Think to yourself, "If I was tripple, if I was in his position, what would I do?" Your answers may vary, but normally we all come to one solution. We decide to quit.

If you ever feel down, or are upset, self harm isn't the choice to go. I've learned this the hard way, self harm only makes you more upset and depressed at yourself because you'll look back and think, "Man, why did I do that? There were so many other options."

To those struggling with suicidal thoughts, there's help. It could be as small as a friend online, or as much as a psychatrist, there is help. Go seek it. I believe in you. You can make it through this.

My turn to leave has come, and I must go now.

Thank you.

Sincerely, Kanteer/tripple.
